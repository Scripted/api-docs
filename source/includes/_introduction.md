# Introduction

> Heads up! Most of the Ruby examples use the `scripted_client` RubyGem. To get started using the Gem, check out the [docs](https://github.com/Scripted/ScriptedClient)!

Welcome to the **Scripted API**. As far as we know, it's the only way to programatically and scaleably generate original, creative written content.

This API follows **RESTful** conventions and communicates in **JSON**. One caveat before we begin: due to the nature of content, this API is kind of asynchronous. You can post a job synchronously, but you'll have to come back 3-5 days later to retrieve the written content. If you need us to fire webhooks upon events (e.g. - "your content is ready for review") please get in touch!
