# Jobs

Jobs are at the very center of the Scripted domain model. They represent a request for writing to be fulfilled by one of our freelancers. They are forged from a [JobTemplate](#job-templates), and include either a list of [Industries](#industries) or a single [Specialty](#specialties). Specialist jobs are completed by freelancers with more depth of knowledge, so they cost a bit more.
