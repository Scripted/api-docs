Pitches are individual topic ideas pitched by Writers. You can accept or reject Pitches. If you accept a Pitch, it becomes a [Job](#jobs), to be completed by the Writer who pitched the idea.

Pitches are nested within [Pitchsets](#pitchsets), so all actions are namespaced under the URL of the Pitch's Pitchset.
