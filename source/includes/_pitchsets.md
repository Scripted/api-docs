# Pitchsets

Our writers can pitch you content ideas. A Pitchset is a lot like a [Job](#jobs) (it's forged from a [JobTemplate](#job-templates) with [Prompt](#prompts) answers, [Industries](#industries) and [Guidelines](#guidelines)), but instead of being a request for writing, it is a request for [topics to be pitched by our writers](#pitches).
